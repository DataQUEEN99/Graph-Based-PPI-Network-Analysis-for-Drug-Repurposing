# Graph-Based-PPI-Network-Analysis-for-Drug-Repurposing
Graph-based analysis of Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks to identify key hub proteins and disease modules. The project applies network biology and graph theory to propose potential drug repurposing candidates using existing drug–target data.
